# CHALLENGE: APPLY OOP CONCEPTS

Build a console application that models a simple library system.

Requirements:

1. Create an Item class that contains basic properties like Title and ID.
2. Create two derived classes: Book and Magazine.
3. Implement polymorphism by overriding a method to display the type of item (Book or Magazine).
4. Use encapsulation to ensure that ID cannot be directly modified.
5. Implement abstraction using an abstract class or interface that defines common behaviors for all library items.
6. Demonstrate inheritance by sharing common functionality between Book and Magazine.
